<h1>Wizard</h1>
<h3>JS Plugin for for Onboarding/Tours/Wizards (using JQuery)</h3>

Disclaimer: This is the very first step I'm taking into GitHub project. My first project published here.. So I am pretty sure I that one day I will look back into this first version of ReadMe and realize how embarrassingly novice it looks.

This plugin was developed for the User onboarding of the new Womplify.com. Its aim is to supply a very powerful Wizard/Tour/Guide/Onboarding mechanism with very powerful feature-set.

Sorry.. No documentation yet.

Promise to fix that <em>soon</em>.

For now, anyone who somehow finds his/her way here and wants to give it a try, <u>get in touch with me</u> and I promise to help.

Best,
Ron
